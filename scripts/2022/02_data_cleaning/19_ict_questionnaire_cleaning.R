# PISA 2022 ICT Questionnaire Cleaning
# --------------------------------------
# Purpose: This script processes the ICT Questionnaire data by:
# 1. Handling missing values (98, 99, NA) following PISA guidelines
# 2. Converting categorical and binary variables appropriately
# 3. Performing debugging analysis before and after cleaning
# 4. Preparing data for analysis based on transformation rules

# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(readr)

# CSV and RDS helper Function
save_cleaned <- function(df, csv_path) {
  write_csv(df, csv_path)
  rds_path <- str_replace(csv_path, ".csv$", ".rds")
  saveRDS(df, rds_path)
  cat("✅ Data saved as CSV:", csv_path, "\n")
  cat("✅ Data saved as RDS:", rds_path, "\n")
}

# Define file paths
input_path <- "data/private/processed/2022/pisa2022_cleaned_9_student_questionnaire_cleaning.rds"
output_path <- "data/private/processed/2022/pisa2022_cleaned_10_ict_questionnaire_cleaning.csv"
debug_path <- "data/private/metadata/2022/pisa2022_cleaned_10_debugging_analysis.csv"

# Load dataset
df <- readRDS(input_path)

# ----------------------------
# Automatically Identify ICT Questionnaire Variables
# ----------------------------

# Identify first and last ICT questionnaire variables
first_ict_var <- "school_use_desktop_laptop"  
last_ict_var <- "can_represent_solution_steps"  

# Get all column names between the first and last student questionnaire variable

  ict_vars <- names(df)[which(names(df) == first_ict_var):which(names(df) == last_ict_var)]
} else {
  ict_vars <- intersect(names(df), c(first_ict_var, last_ict_var)) # Ensure it doesn't break if one variable is missing
}

# Ensure that only variables that exist in df are processed
ict_vars <- intersect(ict_vars, names(df))

# ----------------------------
# Debugging Analysis (Before Cleaning)
# ----------------------------
