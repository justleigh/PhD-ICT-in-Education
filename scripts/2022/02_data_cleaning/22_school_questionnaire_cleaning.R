# PISA 2022 School Questionnaire Variables Cleaning
# --------------------------------------
# Purpose: This script processes the School Questionnaire Variables by:
# 1. Handling missing values (98, 99, 999, NA) following PISA guidelines
# 2. Handling 95 (Valid Skip) and 97 (Random Skip) values following PISA guidelines
# 3. Converting categorical and binary variables appropriately
# 4. Performing debugging analysis before and after cleaning
# 5. Preparing data for analysis based on transformation rules

# Load necessary libraries
